# Product Carousel
 
- Built as a native modern reusable Web Component (no external libs/frameworks)
- Works on modern browsers, but best viewed on Chrome with DevTools turned off
- Swipeable scrolling with snap-points and responsive layout
- Indicators are responsive to tap/click
- Star-rating accurately displays the decimal number rating instead of rounding to halfs
- Works with any background-color
- The indicators attribute can be set to false to preserve space
- The accent-color attribute is any valid hex or color name
- The focus-outline attribute can be set to true if you want to uglify the carousel for keyboard users/accessibility
- Don't be scared of the JS panel - this custom element is portable and styles stay scoped. The CSS panel was not part of core code.
- But are we sure this carousel is really necessary? ðŸ˜‰
